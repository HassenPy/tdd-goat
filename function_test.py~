# Popei uses an online to-do app.
# He opens the home page
browser.get('http://127.0.0.1:8000')

# He notices the page title and header mention to-do lists
assert 'To-Do' in browser.title

# He wants to enter a to-do item as usual

# He types "Buy TDD book" into a text box

# When he hits enter, the page updates and now the page lists
# "1: Buy TDD book" as an item in a to-do list
